# Routing Table Viewer

The **Routing Table Viewer** is a simple C# console application that allows you to view the routing table of your local device. You can choose to either view the routing table for your local device or specify an IP address to display the routing table for a specific device. This tool is useful for network administrators and those interested in understanding the routing configuration of their network.

## Usage

When you run the application, you will be presented with two options:

- **Option 1**: View the routing table of the local device. This option provides an overview of the routing table on your computer.
- **Option 2**: Enter the IP address of a device to display its routing table. You can use this option to examine the routing information for a specific device on your network.

## How to Use

1. Compile the C# code using your preferred C# compiler or an integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.

2. Run the compiled executable.

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to select an option and, if needed, enter the IP address of the device you want to view the routing table for.

4. The application will execute the appropriate command and display the routing table information in the console.

## Note

Please ensure that you have the necessary permissions to execute the `route print` command. Additionally, the application provides a convenient way to inspect and understand the routing configuration of your network.
